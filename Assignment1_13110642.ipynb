        "The paper Generative Adversarial Nets (Goodfellow et al. 2014) proposed a new concept where a sample is taken to train two models together which then compete against each other. The first model known as discriminative model D does everything it can to increase the chance of the second model; generative model G of making a mistake and vice versa. By doing so both models continuously improve until they make a near identical match to the origin of where the sample came from. \n",

        "To prove the framework was successful, the authors pass random noise through a multilayer perceptron; i.e. an algorithm for both the generative model and discriminative model. The algorithm used is shown below:\n",
