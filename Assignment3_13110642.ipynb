        "##Background\n",
        "The term ‘on time performance’ (OTP)  is used in aviation to define when a flight arrives or departs within 15 minutes of its scheduled arrival or departure (Department of Infrastructure Transport Cities and Regional Development 2019). Delays are when the flight arrives or departs greater than 15 minutes of its scheduled time. In the 2019 financial year, Australian airlines in total had an overall arrival OTP of 79.4% and a departure OTP of 80.6% (Department of Infrastructure Transport Cities and Regional Development 2019). 2.1% of Australian airline flights were cancelled which equates to 11575 flights (Department of Infrastructure Transport Cities and Regional Development 2019). \n",
        "\n",
        "Flight delays and cancellations are unfortunately a common and inevitable issue for airlines and its passengers. They can be caused by various issues, but some of the reasons are due to bird strikes, adverse weather and mechanical issues (Busson 2019). Each year the cost of delays to the airline industry exceed \\$US8 billion, while also costing passengers worldwide more than double this amount of \\$US17 billion (The Associated Press 2014). It is near impossible to prevent bird strikes and adverse weather as these occur naturally, however for mechanical issues this is an issue that could potentially be reduced in causing delays and cancellations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Airlines have already begun to recognise the potential of data science and how it can be used to make improvements to its business and daily operations. One such way is through aircraft maintenance. The idea has been proposed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and backed by various airlines to use data science to assist in the maintenance of aircraft (Goudarzi 2019). This use of data science on aircraft maintenance has been termed Aircraft Health Monitoring (AHM) which collects and analyses data to determine what type of maintenance and when aircraft maintenance should be undertaken (Goudarzi 2019). Though the concept and potential of AHM has been positively recognised and noticed as a game changer, it has not reached the stages of being common practice amongst airlines due to various issues; the main one being the willingness of the various airlines and the aircraft producer to openly share their flight and maintenance data with one another which could potentially reduce a company’s competitive advantage (Taylor 2019).\n"

        "##Research Project\n",
        "AHM concept can be compared to the way humans use systems to monitor their vitals such as tracking blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and weight (Goudarzi 2019). In AHM, the “vitals” of an aircraft that would be monitored would be flight hours, flight cycles, engine cycles, temperatures and vibrations (Goudarzi 2019) This project proposes to further utilise the concept of AHM in the maintenance of aircraft by providing an airline with a fleet wide overview of all its aircraft. By using historical technical data and comparing it to live data, it will be able to predict and calculate when maintenance on an aircraft needs to be done, so that the maintenance on certain parts of an aircraft can be scheduled in without affecting flights or operations; i.e. overnight or during scheduled maintenance. *Figure 1* below shows an example of what the user interface would show. Each aircraft that the airline owns would be displayed and indicate a status. Green would indicate no issues, amber indicating maintenance is recommended, and red indicates maintenance is required.\n",
